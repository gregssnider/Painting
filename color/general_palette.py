""" A low-chroma palette extended with high-chroma warms (red) and cools (blue).

By keeping the chroma low, color harmony is ensured. Extending this on the fly
to create a more colorful palette (e.g. by boosting the chroma of red) is easy.

Hues:
    Since 5YR is generally considered the hue of most skin, we include that as
    our base and pick up all of the "5" hues, yielding 10 of the 40 Munsell
    hues.

Values:
    Only 5 from the Munsell scale: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Note that Munsell uses an
    11 value scale, from 0 to 10, so that the values 1 and 9 are not pure black
    or pure white, respectively.

Chroma:
    Peak chroma is assigned to value 7, declining linearly to values 1 and 9.
    This is appropriate for light colored objects, such as Caucasian skin, but
    is not appropriate for darker objects. For example, black skin has a
    peak chroma near the value of 5. Chroma can be toned down on the fly by
    blending in the appropriate value of gray.

    Here's the map for a peak chroma value of 4. This map is sometimes called
    the "chroma curve" for an object with a local color of chroma 4 at value 7:

         value     chroma
         -----     ------
           9          1
           7          4
           5          3
           3          2
           1          1

The swatches are broken into 3 sections: soft, warm, cool

Soft swatches, max chroma = 3:

         1    3    5    7    9    <-- Value
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |           5RP          |
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |           5R           |        ^
      +----+----+----+----+----+        |
      |           5YR          |       Hue
      +----+----+----+----+----+        |
      |           5Y           |        V
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |           5GY          |
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |           5G           |
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |           5BG          |
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |           5B           |
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |           5PB          |
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |           5P           |
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |        grayscale       |
      +----+----+----+----+----+

In addition to those soft colors, you add either hot swatches or cool swatches
(but not both) to form a harmonious palette. We use red rather than orange
as the peak of the gamut for one reason: lipstick.

Hot swatches, added for a hot gamut:

         1    3    5    7    9      max chroma
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |           5P           |        6
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |           5RP          |        9
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |           5R           |        6
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |         grayscale      |        0   A spacer
      +----+----+----+----+----+

Cool swatches, added for a cool gamut:

         1    3    5    7    9      max chroma
      +----+----+----+----+----+
      |           5BG          |        6
